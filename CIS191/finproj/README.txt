For the final project, I plan to make a calendar with a to-do list feature.  I would like to add a feature where you can add events to your calendar with information about it included and processed (such as if it is recurring, start date and time, end date and time, the importance of the event, if you would like any part of it added to the background, and if it should be added to the to-do list.  Another feature would be adding items to the to-do list, with the option for recurring, importance of the action, if you would like this action to be “bumped” and when, and if you want it added to your calendar.  The calendar will also print out a warning if you are about the write over another event and tell you the importance of that event.  You can ask the calendar what you have at a specific time/time range or when you have a certain event/free time.  The to-do list will have a feature to say when a task is finished, to print what tasks you have left, prioritized by importance or due date, and will have pop-ups for any announcements.  You will also be able to import and scrape birthdays/holidays for the calendar and tasks for the to-do list from documents.
Tools:
To do this project, I will be using a lot of things we have already learned in class, but also learning some new Linux tools.  I will be using the scrape .sh file, as well as the creation of text files to store the calendar events and tasks, as well as to update them with the various commands.  I will either have a number of .sh files or functions in a main file depending on how I want to implement it.  I will add event to the background list of commands like we did in class if they are inputted to do such.  One new tool I will have to learn is how to create pop-up windows and edit them.  There will likely be more things as I begin implementation and run with new ideas.
